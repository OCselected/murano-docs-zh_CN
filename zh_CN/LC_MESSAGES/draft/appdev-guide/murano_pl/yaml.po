"YAML is an easily readable data serialization format that is a superset of "
"JSON. Unlike JSON, YAML is designed to be read and written by humans and "
"relies on visual indentation to denote nesting of data structures. This is "
"similar to how Python uses indentation for block structures instead of curly"
" brackets in most C-like languages. Also YAML may contain more data types as"
" compared to JSON. See http://yaml.org/ for a detailed description of YAML."

"MuranoPL is designed to be representable in YAML so that MuranoPL code could"
" remain readable and structured. Usually MuranoPL files are YAML encoded "
"documents. But MuranoPL engine itself does not deal directly with YAML "
"documents, and it is up to the hosting application to locate and deserialize"
" the definitions of particular classes. This gives the hosting application "
"the ability to control where those definitions can be found (a file system, "
"a database, a remote repository, etc.) and possibly use some other "
"serialization formats instead of YAML."

"MuranoPL engine relies on a host deserialization code when detecting YAQL "
"expressions in a source definition. It provides them as instances of the "
"YaqlExpression class rather than plain strings. Usually, YAQL expressions "
"can be distinguished by the presence of $ (the dollar sign) and operators, "
"but in YAML, a developer can always state the type by using YAML tags "
"explicitly. For example:"
