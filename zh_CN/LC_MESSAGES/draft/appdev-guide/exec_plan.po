"An execution plan template is a set of metadata that describes the "
"installation process of an application on a virtual machine. It is a minimal"
" executable unit that can be triggered in Murano workflows and is "
"understandable to the Murano agent, which is responsible for receiving, "
"correctness verification and execution of the statements included in the "
"template."
