"You may want to create compound combinations of applications dynamically "
"from simple app blocks. And you can create an environment that satisfies "
"your requirements in a matter of minutes. Examples of such an environment "
"may be “Jenkins+Java+Tomcat” or “Jenkins+Gerrit+Java+JBoss”. So testing "
"application in different environment combinations becomes easier."

"Any external service or technology may be linked to the application in the "
"cloud. It can be done using the powerful Murano architecture. For example, "
"Murano supports Docker and OracleDB applications, and to enable this support"
" no single change was made to Murano itself. So, users can integrate with "
"new external services with a minimum cost. Currently, murano applications "
"have been integrated with the following technologies: Docker, Legacy apps "
"VMs or bare metal, apps outside of OpenStack, and the following ones are "
"planned for the future: cloudify and TOSCA, apache brooklin, APS."
