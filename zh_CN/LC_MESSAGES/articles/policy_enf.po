"As a part of the policy guided fulfillment, we need to enforce policies on "
"the Murano environment deployment. If the policy enforcement failed, "
"deployment fails. Policies are defined and evaluated in the Congress_ "
"project. The policy language for Congress is Datalog. The congress policy "
"consists of Datalog rules and facts. The cloud administrator defines "
"policies in Congress. Examples of such policies:"
